Usage: ./dns-tcp2udp <dest ip> <listen ip> [listen ip]...

Accepts TCP connections and forwards them using UDP.

Incoming connections have a read buffer large enough to process a single DNS
packet but no write buffer. If the socket write buffer is full the connection
is closed. If there has been no UDP reponse for 30 seconds the connection is
closed. Each TCP socket connection creates a separate UDP socket connection
so that replies (should) go to the correct client.

A hard maximum of 300 connections is enforced. New connections will be ignored
until existing connections are closed.
