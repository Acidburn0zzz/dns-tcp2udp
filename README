Usage: dns-tcp2udp <dest ip> <listen ip> [listen ip]...

Accepts TCP connections from one or more <listen ip> and forwards them using
UDP to <dest ip>.

Incoming connections have the read/write buffers set to large enough to
process a single DNS packet but no more. If the socket write buffer is
full the connection is closed. If there has been no UDP reponse for 30
seconds the connection is closed. Each TCP socket connection creates a
separate UDP socket connection so that replies (should) go to the correct
client.

A hard maximum of 300 connections is enforced. New connections will be ignored
until existing connections are closed. Changes to UID/GID 65534 before forking.
